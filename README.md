# confidant

This is my clean and simple password manager!

# Idea
I came up with the ideia of developing it for two reasons.  
The first one is to learn more about technologies and concepts I don't usually use at work.  
The second reason is due to a need I realized I have in some ocasions when I can't use a consolidated password manager. And then I thought 'Why not create my own?!'  

# Details
I decided to start developing a command line tool and then upgrade it with time.

# Main Technologies
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander)

# What it can do (for now)
- Create new item in database (with name, username/email and password).
- Retrieve list of created items.
- Retrieve password of specific item by id.
- Create passwords based on the user input.
- Save information locally.
